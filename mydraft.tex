	\begin{abstract}
		IEEE Young Professionals Affinity Group in the Montreal chapter is hosting a free virtual \LaTeX training workshop. All students at all levels are welcome to attend, however, registration is mandatory through the secure IEEE web portal. This workshop will cover all your needs to write your technical reports, thesis, and paper, by introducing the well-known libraries to deal with math typing, figures, algorithms, tables, references, etc. We will have virtual breaks as well as a Q\&A section.

We already covered this section over the slides. 

\section{Hello World}
\label{sec:hello}


We did it in the early times. 

\input{typeset.tex}

\section{Labeling and Referencing}

Here I would like to call introduction section by using command \verb|\ref{label}|. Section \ref{sec:intro}. Let us call subsection! In subsection \ref{subsec:paragraph}, we covered paragraph.


\input{mathtyping.tex}


\section{Tables}
Here we are going to deal with the table stuff in \LaTeX. The very first version of our table can be designed like this: 

\begin{table}[t]
	\centering
	\label{tab:myfirstab}
\begin{tabular}{| c | c |}
	\hline
	\textbf{Notation} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
		$x$ & This is the description for this notation \\ \hline
		$y$ & This is the description for this notation \\ \hline
		$z$ & This is the description for this notation \\ \hline
		$w$ & This is the description for this notation \\ \hline
		$\alpha$ & This is the description for this notation \\ \hline
		$\beta$ & This is the description for this notation \\ \hline
		$\int_{a}^{b} f(x)$  & This is the description for this notation \\ \hline
		$\lambda$ & This notation is related to Eq. \ref{eq:sample05} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{\textsc{This is my first table}}	
\end{table}


%
%\begin{table}[]
%	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|}
%		\hline
%		&    &    &    &    &   &  &  &  \\ \hline
%		& \multicolumn{5}{l|}{} &  &  &  \\ \hline
%		&    &    &    &    &   &  &  &  \\ \hline
%		&    &    &    &    &   &  &  &  \\ \hline
%	\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


\begin{table}[hb]
	\centering
	\label{tab:mysecondtab}
	\begin{tabular}{ c || c }
	%	\hline
		\textbf{Notation} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline \hline
		$x$ & This is the description for this notation \\ \hline
		$y$ & This is the description for this notation \\ \hline
		$z$ & This is the description for this notation \\ \hline
		$w$ & This is the description for this notation \\ \hline
		$\alpha$ & This is the description for this notation \\ \hline
		$\beta$ & This is the description for this notation \\ \hline
		$\int_{a}^{b} f(x)$  & This is the description for this notation \\ \hline
		$\lambda$ & This notation is related to Eq. \ref{eq:sample05} \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{\textsc{This is my first table}}	
\end{table}



\section{Figures}
\label{sec:figures}

Here we will need to have a specific package called \verb|\usepackage{graphicx, graphics, subcaption}|. Then, we need to define the path of the figures. We need to do it right after \verb|\begin{document}| and the command to do that is \verb|graphicspath{the path goes here}|. Now, we are all set to use packages. 


\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{OldPort.jpg}
	\caption{Old Port}
	\label{fig:oldport}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{Matthias.jpg}
	\caption{Mont-Royal}
		\label{fig:Mont-Royal}
\end{figure}


I would like to call figure like this. Fig. \ref{fig:oldport}. Now, how to deal with the subfigures. 

\section{Bibliography and Citations}
First, you need to create a bib file. Then, you put your bibtex inside it. Further, you need to call it before \verb|\end{document}|. Let us call the reference \cite{my-paper}.
