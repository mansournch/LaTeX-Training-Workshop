\subsection{Paragraph}
\label{subsec:paragraph}

\paragraph{This is my paragraph:} \lipsum[1]

\subsubsection{Sub paragraph}
\subparagraph{This is my subparagraph:} IEEE Young Professionals Affinity Group in the Montreal chapter is hosting a free virtual LaTeX training workshop. All students at all levels are welcome to attend, however, registration is mandatory through the secure IEEE web portal. This workshop will cover all your needs to write your technical reports, thesis, and paper, by introducing the well-known libraries to deal with math typing, figures, algorithms, tables, references, etc. We will have virtual breaks as well as a Q\&A section. 


\subsection{Table of contents:} We have generated our table of contents by using command  \verb|\tableofcontents|. 


\subsection{Font Effects}
There are some commands in Latex that allows you deal with effects. For instance, if you want to make a bold font, you can write \textbf{like this}. So the command to do it is \verb|\textbf{text}|. How to make it italic? This is \textit{italic word}. We made it by using command \verb|\textit{text}|. \textit{\textbf{this is my bold and italic text simultaneously}}.  \underline{This is underlined text}. \textsc{This is my small capital text}. 

\subsubsection{Font Size}

{\tiny This is my tiny text. }  % this is my tiny text generated by \tiny command

{\scriptsize This is my script size text.}

{\footnotesize  This is my footnote size} 

{\small This is my small size text.}

{\normalsize This is my normal size text.}

{\large this is my large text}

{\Large This is my Large text}

{\LARGE This is my very LARGE text}

{\huge This is my huge text.}



\subsubsection{Colors}

Latex supports a package for coloring. Just you need to use \verb|\usepackage{color}|. We need to put this command before \verb|\begin{document}|. The only thing that you need to have is using command \verb|{\color{your color}  your text goes here.}|

{\color{red} This is my red font text}. {\color{green} This is my green font text}. {\color{blue} This is my blue font text}. {\color{yellow} This is my yellow font text}. {\color{cyan} This is my cyan font text}. {\color{magenta} This is my magenta font text}.
